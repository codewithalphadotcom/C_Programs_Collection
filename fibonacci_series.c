/*
 * Program: Fibonacci Series Generator
 * Purpose: This program teaches beginners about:
 *          - Mathematical sequences and patterns
 *          - Loop-based sequence generation
 *          - Variable updating and state management
 *          - Input validation techniques
 *          - Multiple output formatting approaches
 * Demonstrates: Famous mathematical sequence implementation
 * 
 * Fibonacci Sequence Background:
 * - Named after Leonardo Fibonacci (Italian mathematician, ~1170-1250)
 * - Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers
 * - Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 * - Formula: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0)=0, F(1)=1
 * - Found everywhere in nature: flower petals, spiral shells, tree branches

/*
 * KEY LEARNING POINTS:
 * 
 * 1. MATHEMATICAL SEQUENCES:
 *    - Sequences have patterns that can be expressed as formulas
 *    - Fibonacci: each term = sum of two previous terms
 *    - Many natural phenomena follow Fibonacci patterns
 *    - Understanding the pattern is key to programming it
 * 
 * 2. LOOP-BASED GENERATION:
 *    - Use loops when you need to repeat a calculation
 *    - Each iteration builds on the previous results
 *    - Loop variable (i) often represents position in sequence
 * 
 * 3. VARIABLE STATE MANAGEMENT:
 *    - Keep track of "current state" using variables
 *    - Update variables at end of each iteration
 *    - Order of updates is crucial (first, then second)
 * 
 * 4. INPUT VALIDATION:
 *    - Always check if user input makes sense
 *    - Return error codes for invalid input
 *    - Prevent program from continuing with bad data
 * 
 * 5. SPECIAL CASES HANDLING:
 *    - First two Fibonacci numbers don't follow the general rule
 *    - Handle them separately before starting the loop
 *    - Check boundaries (n>=1, n>=2) before displaying
 * 
 * 6. MULTIPLE OUTPUT FORMATS:
 *    - Same data can be presented in different ways
 *    - Simple series: "0 1 1 2 3 5 8"
 *    - With positions: "F(1)=0, F(2)=1, F(3)=1..."
 *    - Choose format based on user needs
 * 
 * 7. FIBONACCI IN REAL WORLD:
 *    - Nature: flower petals, pinecones, spiral shells
 *    - Art: golden ratio (phi â‰ˆ 1.618) appears in Fibonacci ratios
 *    - Computer science: algorithm analysis, data structures
 *    - Finance: technical analysis, market patterns
 * 
 * 8. ALGORITHM EFFICIENCY:
 *    - This iterative approach is efficient: O(n) time complexity
 *    - Alternative recursive approach is much slower: O(2^n)
 *    - Understanding efficiency helps choose right algorithm
